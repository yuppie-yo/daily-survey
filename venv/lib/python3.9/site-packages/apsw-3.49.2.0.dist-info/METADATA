APSW stands for **A**\ nother **P**\ ython **S**\ QLite **W**\ rapper.   APSW
supports CPython 3.9 onwards.

About
=====

APSW lets you get the most out of the `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/>`__
embedded relational database engine from Python, and the most out of
Python from SQLite.  APSW glues together the complete `SQLite C API
<https://sqlite.org/c3ref/intro.html>`__ and `Python's C API
<https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html>`__, staying up to date
with both SQLite and Python.  This includes `full text search
<https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/textsearch.html>`__.


It is recommended to use the builtin `sqlite3 module
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`__ if you want SQLite
to appear interchangeable with the other database drivers.

Use APSW when you want to use SQLite fully, and have an improved
developer experience.  The `documentation
<https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/pysqlite.html>`__ has a section on
the differences between APSW and sqlite3.
